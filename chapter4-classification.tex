\section{Representing Sports Poses in Latent Space}

To obtain embeddings of the images, a convolutional neural network is used. This thesis uses a ResNet architecture with weights trained on ImageNet dataset. The head of the network is replaced to provide embeddings as vectors in $d$-dimensional latent space. The network is trained on triplet loss in the self-supervised manner.

\section{Models for Sports Pose Classification from Embeddings}

The sports poses are encoded as $d$-dimensional latent vectors. Then, simple models that solve the classification problem are proposed. These models do not require many annotated samples to have good performance. After that, more advanced models are proposed.
