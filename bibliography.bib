@book{ComputerVision,
    author = {Szeliski, Richard},
    title = {Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications},
    year = {2010},
    isbn = {1848829345},
    publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
    address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
    edition = {1},
    abstract = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of recipes, this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses; presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects; provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory; suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book; supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/. Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.}

    abstract="Self-training plays an important role in sports exercise, but improper training postures can cause serious harm to muscles and ligaments of the body. Hence, more and more researchers are devoted into the development of computer-assisted self-training systems for sports exercise. In this paper, we propose a Yoga posture recognition system, which is capable of recognizing what Yoga posture the practitioner is performing, and then retrieving Yoga training information from Internet to remind his/her attention to the posture. First, a Kinect is used for capturing the user body map and extracting the body contour. Then, star skeleton, which is a fast skeletonization technique by connecting from centroid of target object to contour extremes, is used as a representative descriptor of human posture for Yoga posture recognition. Finally, some Yoga training information for the recognized posture can be retrieved from Internet to remind the practitioner what to pay attention to when practicing the posture.",
