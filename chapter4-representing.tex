\chapter{\label{chap:representing}Representing Sports Poses in a Latent Space}

To obtain embeddings of the images, a convolutional neural network is used. This thesis uses a ResNet architecture with weights trained on ImageNet dataset. The head of the network is replaced to provide embeddings as vectors in $d$-dimensional latent space. The network is trained on triplet loss in the self-supervised manner.
